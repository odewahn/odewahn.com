This is my simple homepage.  To build it:

* Download the repo
* Run `npm install`
* Run `npm init`
* Open browser to `localhost:8000`

Some things to note:

* Source data is all in [data.js](data.js)
* This was a way to try out [material-ui](http://www.material-ui.com/#/) package for styling.
* I've eschewed Gulp and just tried to [use npm as a build tool](http://blog.keithcirkel.co.uk/how-to-use-npm-as-a-build-tool/).  Life is complex enough without more tool.
